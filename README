rtoo is a piece of code written in python. What it does is to manage/configure bandwidth
of your client machines based on several criteria IP,port etc. It has a shell like
configuration interface which you can find in commercial management tools. In a nutshell,
something like this;

rtoo> setbw 192.168.1.0/27 1mbit
rtoo> setbw 192.168.1.32/27 512kbit

The sample commands given above will set respective bandwidth for IP addresses
rtoo still needs time for its first release but I am pretty hopeful about my project.
I have also some plans to add routing/firewall management once traffic control module
is matured.
  If anyone is also interested, please join me.


Genco.
